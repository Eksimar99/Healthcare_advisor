# Healthcare_advisor
## 1. Overview

Healthcare Advisor is a web application powered by Google Gemini Pro that provides medical-related information, including symptoms, precautions, advisories for diseases, and curated diet plans based on specified health conditions. It leverages GenAI prompt engineering and Large Language Models (LLMs) to deliver accurate and relevant insights. The application is deployed using Streamlit, ensuring a seamless and interactive user experience.

## 2. Features
* Disease Information: Get details about any disease, including symptoms, causes, and treatment options.
* Precautionary Measures: Learn about precautions to take to prevent or manage a disease effectively.
* Medical Advisories: Receive AI-generated advisories based on current medical knowledge.
* Diet Planning: Generate customized diet plans tailored to specific health concerns.
* User-Friendly Interface: Accessible and easy to use via a Streamlit-based web UI.

## 3. Technologies Used

* Google Gemini Pro (LLM for AI-driven responses)
* GenAI Prompt Engineering (Optimized AI interaction)
* Streamlit (Web application framework for deployment)
* Python (Primary development language)
* API Integration (for Gemini pro access)

## 4. Installation and Usage 
Here, we will be leveraing the power of LLMs to Build HealthCare Advisor

* **Step 1:** We will create a virtual enviornment and activate it. The code for creating Virtual Enviornment is ``python -m vene.venv`` 

* **Step 2:** Activate the virtual enviornment using the following command  ``source .venv/Scripts/activate``
* **Step 3:** Install the dependencies using the following command ``pip install -r requirements.txt``.

## 5. How It Works
* Users input queries related to diseases, symptoms, or dietary needs.
* The system processes the request using Google Gemini Pro to generate responses.
* The information is presented in a user-friendly interface via Streamlit.
* The AI-driven responses continuously evolve based on prompt engineering techniques.

## 6. Future Enhancements
* Integration with Medical APIs for real-time updates on diseases and treatments.
* User Authentication for personalized recommendations.
* Multi-language Support to enhance accessibility.
* Voice Input Support for hands-free interaction.
